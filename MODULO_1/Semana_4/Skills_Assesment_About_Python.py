----Store Inventory Management System----

Overview:
This system is designed for managing a store's inventory, allowing the user to interact and have a clear perspective of what is currently in the store. It also has a main menu that is designed so that the user can navigate through the different options that the program has.

Features:
 -The system has the following features that allow you to do:
1. Add Products to Inventory: Allows the user to add products with attributes such as name, price, and available quantity.
2. Query Products in Inventory: Search for a product by name and display its details (name, price, quantity).
3. Update Product Prices: Change the price of a specific product in inventory.
4. Remove Products from Inventory: Allows the user to remove a product that is no longer available.
5. Calculate Total Inventory Value: Multiply the price by the quantity of each product and display the running total.

Instructions for running the program:
 -Interactive menu:Initially, when running the program it displays an interactive menu so that the user can select what to do.
 -Add a new product ("add" function):
The first option will allow you to add a new product to your inventory. If the product exists, it updates the quantity of the product in your inventory.
   -It prompts the user for the following information:
1. The name of the product.
2. The quantity of the product.
3. The price of the product.
 -Search for a product ("search" function):
The second option asks the user for the product name, and if the product is not found, it tells them that it has not been found. If it is, it displays details about it (quantity, price).
 -Update a product's price ("Update" function):
The third option initially asks the user for the name of the product whose price they wish to update. If the product is not in inventory, a message is displayed informing them. If the product is in inventory, it shows the current price and asks for the new price.
 -Delete product (Delete function):
The fourth option asks the user for the name of the product they wish to delete. If the product does not exist, a message appears stating that the product was not entered. If it exists, the user is asked again if they wish to delete it. If the answer is yes, the user deletes it. If not, the product remains in the inventory.
 -Calculate Total Inventory Value ("calculate" function):
 The fifth option calculates the total value of the inventory, taking into account the products, their quantities and their prices.
 -Exit:The last option ends the system.

Programming language: Python
